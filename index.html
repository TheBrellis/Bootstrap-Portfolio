              <p>Hello! My name is Brian Ellis. I currently work as a Senior Associate Engineer for Burndy LLC in
                Manchester NH. At Burndy, I work designing electrical connectors for grounding applications in the
                Utility, C&I, and OEM industries. I graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 2017 with a degree
                in Mechanical Engineering. After a couple of years in the professional world, I started to miss the pace
                and structure that academia provided. And so, I started to look for more avenues in which I could
                furthur my education and improve my career prospects. While I was in school, I lived in a house with 3
                Software Engineers and a Systems Engineer, so the influence of a programmers mindset was constant. I
                loved listening to them breakdown how they approached problems and how they constanstly had to adapt to
                an everchanging tech world. I was hooked. I attempted to teach myself Python and Arduino, but as my
                schedule and priorities shifted I quickly fell out of the routine. Until I stumbled upon UNH's Fullstack
                Web Dev Coding Bootcamp. After some consideration I decided that it would be now or never. Longing for
                the structure and emersion that helped me to learn so much in college, I signed up and here we are! One
                website down and many more to come. I look forward to what my future in programming holds!</p>
